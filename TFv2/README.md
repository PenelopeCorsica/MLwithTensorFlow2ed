# MLwithTensorFlow2-2ed
---

Exercises and listings for ["Machine Learning with TensorFlow 2nd Edition"](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-second-edition) using TensorFlow2. The original listings, which use TensorFlow (1) are available on [Chris Mattmann's GitHub page](https://github.com/chrismattmann/MLwithTensorFlow2ed)

## Methodology
---

The examples, exercises, and listings in the text and on Chris' GitHub page will be translated from TensorFlow to TensorFlow2 using the official [TF1 to TF2 migration guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate). Note that we are not attempting to use the [upgrade script](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade) for two reasons:

- 1 ["The conversion script automates as much as possible, but there are still syntactical and stylistic changes that cannot be performed by the script."](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade)
- 2 There is value for the author (of this repository) in fully examining the changes from TF1 to TF2 (i.e., this is a learning experience).
